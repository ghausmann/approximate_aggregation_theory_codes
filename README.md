# approximate_aggregation_theory_codes

In this repository you will find all the replication files from the working paper "Approximate Aggregation Theory for Heterogenous-agent Models" by Guillermo Hausmann-Guil (2022).
The folder "perfect foresight" includes the files to replicate the examples from Section 6 (Krusell-Smith and Savings model).
The folder "aggregate uncertainty" includes the files to replicate the examples from Section 7 (Lucas-tree and two-asset models).
Each folder comes with a README ".txt" file that lists the files and explains what they do. You are welcome to use these files for your own research. Just remember to give credit to the source!
